# KEEL 2.2.0: standard

Reference for the `keel-check` skill, generated from `KEEL.md` (https://github.com/rickflashman/keel). Do not edit by hand.

## Authority and file handling

When `KEEL.md` is in the project root, it is the authoritative reference for project structure, documentation standards, naming conventions, required, recommended, and optional artifacts, and templates and seed content, including for documentation created later. Direct developer instructions and explicit project-specific requirements override it. When project docs disagree with each other, the Precedence list in `AGENTS.md` says which one wins.

AI assistants may read and use the file, but must not delete, rename, move, modify, archive, or otherwise manage it without direct, explicit developer instruction. The developer controls its location and lifecycle, and may ask an AI assistant to update it.

When `KEEL.md` is absent and the KEEL skill is installed, the skill is the reference for the same things. When both are present, `KEEL.md` wins; if their versions differ, tell the developer before you continue.

The docs check script (see *Docs check and drift report*) lives where the project keeps its tests, or in `scripts/` if the project has no test folder.

**Sections that do not apply:** Create every required file and keep all its headings. If a section does not apply, say why in the file. Example: the `ARCHITECTURE.md` Auth & security section says the project has no authentication.

**Files a developer removes:** A developer may decide not to use a file from this standard, even a required one. That decision overrides this standard. List each such file on the "Not used" line of the `AGENTS.md` Docs list. Never recreate a file on that line, and never report it as missing. If a file from this standard is missing and is not on that line, ask the developer once whether to recreate it, and record the answer there.

**Doc files outside the standard:** A migration brings existing docs into the standard at setup. After setup, new doc files can still appear: a notes file, a Word or PDF file, a wiki export, or a second README. When the AI finds such a file, inside or outside `docs/`, it offers to absorb it. Do not link to the file as a source instead. To absorb a file, follow migration steps 3 to 7 for that file only (see `references/migration.md`): resolve currency, map the current content to its target docs, get approval, move the content, and archive the original in `docs/archive/` with a row in `INDEX.md`. Then update every link to the file. If the developer declines, list the file on the "Kept as is" line of the `AGENTS.md` Docs list, and do not offer again. The docs check flags these files (check 5).

**Projects with no UI:** Do not create `DESIGN.md` or `DESIGN-GUIDE.html`, and leave them out of the `AGENTS.md` Docs list. If the project later gains a UI, create both from the templates.

**Returning to a project:** The docs must let a developer, or an AI with no memory, resume work after a break without asking anyone. This works for any project type (web app, API, CLI, library, data pipeline, mobile app). The reading order is in the `README.md` "Start here" section: `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` (how to run it), `docs/FEATURES.md` (what it does and how to use it), the "Architecture at a glance" section of `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (how it fits together), then the handoff file and the work board (where work stopped). Each file has its own job:

| Question | File |
|---|---|
| How do I run and test it? | `DEVELOPMENT.md` |
| What does it do now, and how do I use it? | `FEATURES.md` (intent and acceptance criteria stay in `SPEC.md`; the end-user manual is `USER-GUIDE.md`) |
| How is it built? | `ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Where did we stop? | the handoff file and `PLAN.md` |

`FEATURES.md` describes the interface the project actually has. Do not add interface-specific files to the standard: where a generated reference exists (an OpenAPI file, generated API docs, a CLI `--help` listing), link to it from the feature entry; the entry still says how to use the feature. When a session starts after a long gap, or the developer asks to be caught up, run the catch-up routine (rule 5).

**Projects with end users:** Create `USER-GUIDE.md` once end users have a working feature to use. Write it in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English (STE): short sentences, active voice, and approved words. Describe current behavior as tasks, and put screenshots in `docs/images/`.

**Projects with more than 1 developer:** Count developers, not tools: a solo developer who uses 2 AI tools is still 1 developer. The work board in `PLAN.md` holds the shared state: who holds which item, which files it touches, and its status. Each developer has a handoff file `docs/handoff/<developer>.md` (the developer's name in lowercase with no spaces, such as `rick.md`), rewritten only by that developer's sessions, and `docs/HANDOFF.md` is not used. The Handoff file line in `AGENTS.md` names the form the project uses. A board Owner is a developer name, with the tool after it when useful ("Rick / Claude Code").

Create other optional files only when needed, from their templates, and add them to the `AGENTS.md` Docs list.

**Research versus decisions:** Use `docs/RESEARCH.md` for research results or data that do not belong in the plan, specs, architecture, or decisions.

- **Decision note:** records *what* we chose and *why*, in a sentence or two. Example: "We chose A over B because it was faster." The AI must not reverse it.
- **Research entry:** records the *evidence* behind a choice, such as the actual test results for A and B. If A later fails, the entry shows whether B is a viable fallback. Research entries may be updated.

When a decision rests on research, the decision note links to the research entry.

**Acceptance criteria versus the release checklist:** `SPEC.md` defines correct behavior. Each acceptance criterion has an ID (`AC-1`, `AC-2`, and so on) and its test cases, grouped by feature or milestone, so development can test one part at a time. `RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md` proves a release meets all of them: one check per ID, plus non-test release steps such as updating the version and the docs (rule 6).

**Proposed changes to SPEC and DESIGN:** The AI never edits accepted text in `SPEC.md` or `DESIGN.md` (rule 1). It writes each proposal in the file, next to the text it changes, as a PROPOSED block, never only in chat:

```md
> PROPOSED 2026-10-31 (Claude Code): change AC-3 to allow an empty email.
> Reason: the form now has a guest path. Code: src/forms/signup.js.
```

A PROPOSED block is not a requirement and not a design. The developer accepts it by applying the edit and deleting the marker, rejects it by deleting the block, or tells the AI to do either. The developer may decide on several blocks at once, for example "accept all PROPOSED blocks in SPEC.md". The developer may also accept the blocks of a ready card together with the card, but only by saying so; approval of the card alone does not accept its blocks. A block is named by its file and the AC ID or heading it changes (`SPEC.md AC-3`). The AI lists pending blocks in its task summary and, at the next close, in `HANDOFF.md` under Waiting. No block may remain at a release (rule 6).

**Session handoff versus lasting records:** `docs/HANDOFF.md` is a short, temporary handoff between sessions, tools, or developers, not a general record of what the AI remembers. Before writing to it, the AI routes each item to its proper home and prints the routing (rule 5):

| Content | Goes in |
|---|---|
| A choice and why it was made | `docs/decisions/` |
| Test results, options compared, fallbacks | `docs/RESEARCH.md` |
| Milestones and milestone-level next work | `docs/PLAN.md` |
| Unfinished work that needs its own task | A work board row in `docs/PLAN.md` |
| Commands, structure, stack, environment facts, lasting traps | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Release check results | `docs/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md` |
| Requirement or UI changes | PROPOSED block in `SPEC.md` or `DESIGN.md`; listed in `HANDOFF.md` under Waiting until accepted |

Only leftovers go in `HANDOFF.md`: the immediate next action, questions waiting on a person, unconfirmed assumptions, decisions made without asking, and traps found this session that have not yet moved. It never overrides the other docs. The close routine steps and the same routes sit at the top of the `HANDOFF.md` template, so the AI sees them each time it edits the file, and `AGENTS.md` stays short.

**AI instruction files:** `AGENTS.md` is a shared format that many AI coding tools read, including Claude Code and GitHub Copilot. It holds all the AI working rules, so a project keeps working as tools change. The other two files only point to it, plus optional notes for their own tool. Do not copy rules from `AGENTS.md` into either one.

- `CLAUDE.md` starts with the line `@AGENTS.md`, which imports `AGENTS.md` into Claude Code. The import works in every current Claude Code setup, including sessions that cannot read `AGENTS.md` directly, and never loads the rules twice. Do not replace it with a symbolic link (links need extra permissions on Windows).
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` points GitHub Copilot to `AGENTS.md` for setups that do not read `AGENTS.md` directly. Only GitHub Copilot reads it; *Microsoft Copilot* and *Microsoft 365 Copilot* do not. Note the leading dot in `.github`, and use the exact file name. It needs no GitHub repository or version control. Create it even if you only use Claude Code, so others can use GitHub Copilot with the same rules.

## Project skills

Skills specific to one project live with that project, not in a developer's personal `~/.claude/skills/` folder, where they would apply to every project on that machine.

- **Location:** `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`, one folder per skill. Create `.claude/skills/` if it does not exist (note the leading dot).
- **Naming:** Name the file exactly `SKILL.md`. The folder name must match the `name:` line inside it.
- **Using a skill:** Claude Code or GitHub Copilot can pick one up automatically when it is relevant, or a developer can call it by typing `/<skill-name>`.
- **Listing:** When you add, rename, or remove a skill, update the Skills list in `AGENTS.md`. Some tools do not scan `.claude/skills/` on their own, so that list points them there.

Starting point for a new skill:

```md
---
name: <skill-name>
description: One sentence on what it does and when to use it.
---

# Skill Name
Instructions for the AI go here.
```

## Linking to the project tracker

Most projects have a ticket, work item, or issue in a tracker such as Jira, Azure DevOps, GitHub Issues, or Linear, with a description of the project. Where the table lists a "Seeded from the ticket" section, copy ("seed") the file's first draft from the matching part of that description (for example, a Requirements or Approach section). Which tracker, and what its sections are called, is the project's choice; this standard does not depend on any product.

- `README.md` and every Markdown file in `docs/`, except decision notes and files in `docs/archive/`, start with a header line that names the tracker and the ticket: `> Tracker: TICKET-# (name of project)`, with the tracker's name in place of `Tracker` and the ticket ID in place of `TICKET-#`, for example `> Jira: BOOK-12 (Booking Portal)` or `> GitHub: #42 (Booking Portal)`. The README also links to the ticket and starts with the full ticket description. Projects set up under 1.x keep their `> Jira:` headers; they already follow this form.
- The ticket seeds the first drafts only. After setup, the docs are the source of truth, and the AI never copies the ticket over them. When the ticket changes later, the AI writes the change into the docs like any other change: a PROPOSED block for SPEC or DESIGN, a direct update for the others, and the new description in the README.
- Include the ticket ID in the names of work items and in any notes or messages about the work. Decision notes carry no ticket ID.
- If no ticket ID has been assigned yet, leave the `TICKET-#` placeholder. The developer fills it in later, or gives it to the AI to replace every placeholder.
- If the project has no tracker, replace each header with `> Project: (name of project)`, omit the ticket link and ticket IDs, and ask the developer for a project description to use instead.

## Risk classes

Every change gets 1 class before work starts. The class is defined here once; rules 6, 9, and 10 and the `AGENTS.md` template cite it instead of repeating it. The AI names the class in the ready card or the task summary, so the developer can correct it.

| Class | Trigger | Tests (rule 9) | Review (rule 6) | Plan (rule 10) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Small** | 1 area, no shared code, no ask-before-touching path | Targeted | None | Direct; a ready card if the change touches several files or its approach is unclear |
| **Shared** | Shared code (such as core utilities), the data model, auth, build configuration, a dependency upgrade, a refactor across areas, or a path on the ask-before-touching line in `AGENTS.md` | Affected; ask before a full regression | Fresh-context review of the diff against the acceptance criteria, before the task is done | Ready card, approved first |
| **Release** | A release | Full regression | Fresh-context review and drift report | Release checklist |

## Rules

1. **Humans own SPEC and DESIGN (when it exists),** including the acceptance criteria and their IDs. After the first draft is seeded at setup, the AI may only *propose* edits, as PROPOSED blocks in the file, and must wait for acceptance. Otherwise requirements quietly drift to match whatever the code does.
2. **The AI keeps the docs current.** Every time the application changes, the AI updates the affected files in place, in the same task, not afterward. To find them, it searches `docs/` for each path, name, label, and behavior it changed; the area map and the Glossary give the names. It writes SPEC and DESIGN edits as PROPOSED blocks in the same task, never skips them silently, and never defers doc updates to `HANDOFF.md`. Never create a new version of a doc (such as `SPEC-v2.md`) beside the old one; that leaves several conflicting versions. To change a decision, follow rule 3. How to handle each file:
   - **Update directly:** ARCHITECTURE (including the area map), DEVELOPMENT and FEATURES (when how to run the project, or what a feature does or how it is used, changes), PLAN (including the work board), the `AGENTS.md` Docs and Skills lists, `.env.example` (when environment variables change), and, when used, MOCKUP, RESEARCH, RUNBOOK, and USER-GUIDE (current user-facing behavior only).
   - **Propose:** SPEC and DESIGN, as PROPOSED blocks (rule 1).
   - **Regenerate:** `DESIGN-GUIDE.html` (when used) every time `DESIGN.md` changes.
   - **`RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md`:** keep one check per accepted acceptance criterion; record results only by running the checks (rule 6).
   - **`HANDOFF.md`** (when used): rewrite at session close through the close routine, or to record something important right away (rule 5), not after every change.
   - **`CHANGELOG.md`** (when used): add one entry at the top at each release (rule 6). Do not rewrite old entries.
3. **Decisions are never rewritten.** To change one, write a new note that supersedes it, then mark the old note's Status as Superseded (the only edit allowed). If 2 notes get the same number, the later merge renumbers its note and fixes the Superseded references.
4. **A task is not done until it meets the Definition of done in PLAN.md.** Test the task as rule 9 says; a task does not need a full regression unless rule 9 calls for one. The result must match the ready card, when there was one; anything outside the card is reported, not done.
5. **The session handoff is not a record.** A session runs from the start routine to the next close routine.

   **Start routine**, at the start of every session: read the handoff file if it exists, and the work board in `PLAN.md`. Then state the next action in 1 line before you start work. If the handoff file conflicts with another doc, the other doc wins: say so.

   **Catch-up routine**, when a session starts after a long gap (a week or more since the last handoff or Verified date), or when the developer asks ("catch me up"). Read only; change nothing unless the developer asks:
   1. Read the handoff file, the work board in `PLAN.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, and the Architecture at a glance section.
   2. Summarize what changed since the `Verified` dates in `DEVELOPMENT.md`, `FEATURES.md`, and `ARCHITECTURE.md`: version-control history if any; else `CHANGELOG.md` and the work board Started dates.
   3. Offer to run the `DEVELOPMENT.md` steps from a clean state, to confirm they still work.
   4. Print a briefing of at most 15 lines: where the project stands, how to run it, what each feature does in 1 line, the next action, and which docs look stale (older `Verified` date than the changes, or a command or path that no longer exists). Fix stale docs only after the developer approves.

   **Close routine**, when the developer says the session is closing, before any compact or clear (for example, `/compact` or `/clear`), or when the session has used most of its context:
   1. **Route.** For each item worth keeping, print 1 line: `item -> target doc`, or `item -> HANDOFF (Next | Waiting | Assumed | Decided | Trap)`. Use the routing table. An item that is already in the current `HANDOFF.md` cannot go back to HANDOFF: route it to its doc, to a work board row, or delete it. The one exception is a Waiting bullet for a PROPOSED block that is still pending; check 8 tracks how old those blocks are.
   2. **Write** the routed items into their docs (PROPOSED blocks for SPEC and DESIGN).
   3. **Rewrite** `HANDOFF.md` (never append) with only what step 1 routed there, and print the line count.

   A close with no routing report is incomplete. `HANDOFF.md` stays within its cap (rule 8). Every bullet is dated; an item older than 1 session is moved or deleted, never copied forward. A copy with a new date is still a copy: the docs check compares the bullet text without its date and counts the carries (check 2). After a close at the context limit, tell the developer to start a new session from `HANDOFF.md`; do not continue on a compacted context. If something important would be lost sooner, record it right away in its proper doc or in `HANDOFF.md`, creating the file if needed. On a team, each developer's `docs/handoff/<developer>.md` follows the same rules.
6. **A release is not approved until the release checklist passes.** Before every release, in this order:
   1. A reviewer in a fresh context (a new session or a subagent, not the one that wrote the code) checks the code against the SPEC acceptance criteria, follows `DEVELOPMENT.md` from a clean state and runs each command in `README.md` Run it and `ARCHITECTURE.md` Commands, and reads `README.md`, `FEATURES.md`, and `USER-GUIDE.md` (if used) against the code, trying each feature by its "How to use it" example. It reports only gaps that affect correctness, the requirements, or the docs. Fix each gap or list it for the developer.
   2. Write the drift report (see *Docs check and drift report*). The developer fixes or accepts each finding.
   3. Run a full regression (rule 9): the whole test suite, the docs check, and every check in `RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md`. Never mark a check passed without running it.
   4. Confirm that no PROPOSED block remains in `SPEC.md` or `DESIGN.md`. Review new or upgraded dependencies (license, maintenance, known vulnerabilities).
   5. Record how each check was verified, replace the Latest release section with the result, set the Verified date in `SPEC.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, and `FEATURES.md`, and add the release entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (create the file at the first release).
   6. A human gives the final approval.
7. **Never put secrets in code or docs.** If the project uses environment variables, list their names in `.env.example`. Do not paste secrets or customer data into docs or the tracker. If the project uses version control, make sure `.gitignore` excludes `.env` and the `test-results/` folder (rule 9), creating or updating it if needed. This is the only version-control step this standard asks for; docs check 2 also reads the history of the handoff file.
8. **Keep docs skimmable.** These are the caps, and the docs check uses the same numbers:
   - `AGENTS.md`: 120 lines and 1,200 words (a warning above either, a failure above 140 lines or 1,500 words), because the AI loads it every session. The word cap catches long lines that a line count misses. The template is a maximum, so delete the optional lines that do not apply and list only the docs that exist.
   - Each handoff file: 40 lines (a warning above 40, a failure above 50).
   - `CLAUDE.md` and `copilot-instructions.md`: a few lines.

   Other docs have no line limit: if one is too long to skim, trim it or split it by topic, leaving a link in the original. `RESEARCH.md` grows by design; split it by topic if it becomes unwieldy. In `AGENTS.md`, for each line, ask whether removing it would cause mistakes; if not, cut it. Do not include what the AI can learn from the code or already does by default. Give each project rule a weight (Must, Never, or Prefer) and a short reason, because the AI follows a rule it understands: `Never: edit files in vendor/. Why: they are overwritten at each update.` Add a rule when a real mistake happens, not in advance. Mark at most 1 or 2 lines "IMPORTANT"; if many lines are marked, none stands out. If the AI keeps breaking a rule, or asks a question that `AGENTS.md` already answers, flag to the developer that the file may be too long or unclear.
9. **Test progressively.** Run only the tests a change needs, as the risk class says. The area map in `ARCHITECTURE.md` lists each area, its code, its tests, its command, its acceptance criteria, and the areas it depends on. An area that a change does not touch is not tested again; its last passing result still holds.
   - **Reading code:** read the map before you search the code. Reading the files near the code you change is normal and keeps your view current. The map is for what is not near: the areas that use the changed code, and long-range dependencies such as shared libraries or code in other folders. Do not search the whole project, or the developer's computer, for something the map already answers.
   - **Targeted (the default):** new and updated tests, plus the existing tests for the changed area, plus the docs check.
   - **Affected:** targeted, plus the tests for each area that uses the changed code. Run them for a Shared change. If a targeted test fails in a way that points outside the changed area, run the affected areas without asking.
   - **Full regression:** the whole test suite, the docs check, and every release check. Run it before every release (rule 6) and when the developer asks. For any other reason, ask the developer first and explain why; a Shared change with a wide reach is the typical reason.
   - **Scripted first:** run the saved test commands from the area map. Each run writes a short results file, `test-results/latest.md`: what ran, the pass and fail counts, and details for failures only. The docs check writes `test-results/docs.md` instead, so both results survive the same task. Attach screenshots only for failures or visual checks. Check the exit code and the counts, not only a "passed" line. Test interactively only to debug a failure, to explore a new check before you script it, or for visual checks.
   - **Saved scripts only:** use the project's test framework when it has one. Save each new test script in the project and add its command to the area map. Each test names the acceptance criterion it covers (`AC-n`) in its name or a comment. Do not write throwaway test scripts.
   - **Stronger checks (optional):** for a Shared change or a release, the fresh-context reviewer may also test "what if" cases at the edges of the changed logic. Where the project has a mutation testing tool, it may run it on the changed code, to confirm that the new tests have real assertions. The developer decides whether the project uses these checks. Ask once, when you first fill the `ARCHITECTURE.md` Testing section (at setup or upgrade), with this message as plain chat text, and record the answer on its Stronger checks line:

         Optional stronger checks, for Shared changes and releases only:
         1. Not used (most common): the normal tests only.
         2. What-if cases (recommended): the reviewer also tests the edges
            of the changed logic, such as limits, empty values, and times
            that cross midnight. No tool to install; a little more review time.
         3. What-if cases and mutation testing (rare): a tool (such as Stryker for
            JavaScript or mutmut for Python) changes the code on purpose to
            prove that the tests catch it. Needs the tool; much slower.
         Which one (1, 2, or 3)? You can change it later.

     If the developer does not answer, record option 2 and say so in the task summary.
10. **Plan before code.** Classify the change (Risk classes). For a Shared change, a change that touches several files, or a change whose approach is unclear, write the ready card from the `PLAN.md` Definition of ready and wait for approval. Approval of the card approves the plan, not its PROPOSED blocks (see *Proposed changes to SPEC and DESIGN*). A Small change with a clear approach goes ahead directly. Before a bug fix, reproduce the bug with a failing test or captured error output and save the test; no repro, no fix: ask. Never guess a version pin; read the lock file or ask. If the same fix fails twice, stop, report what you tried, and ask.
11. **Every claim carries evidence.** End every task with the task summary from the `PLAN.md` Definition of done, every line present ("none" if empty); the `AGENTS.md` Reporting section points to it. A test passed only if the results file shows it. A check the AI could not run is reported as "Not run: reason", never as passed. A Shared change is not done until its fresh-context review ran and its findings are fixed or listed. Never weaken, skip, or delete a test to make it pass; report the failure and its cause. After 3 test-fix rounds, stop and report. To dismiss a review finding, cite the file and line that shows it is wrong. Before reporting a task done, re-read the Definition of done and the ready card; this is the cheapest defense against a long context.

## Docs check and drift report

**Docs check** is a saved script in the project's own language, with no new runtime or dependency. When the project has no language yet, check which runtimes are installed on the developer's machine and use one of them; if none fits, write a shell script (`sh` on macOS and Linux, PowerShell on Windows). Port the script when the stack is chosen, and record that in `ARCHITECTURE.md`. It is the one script this standard asks for. It is listed in the area map as area *Docs* and runs with the targeted tests of every change; a red check is a failing test. The AI writes it at setup or upgrade and keeps the list of checks, with these definitions, in the script's header comment, so the list survives without this skill. It writes its results to `test-results/docs.md`, so the area test results in `test-results/latest.md` survive the same task. It checks:

1. `AGENTS.md` is within its caps (rule 8: a warning above 120 lines or 1,200 words, a failure above 140 lines or 1,500 words) and has the version stamp.
2. `docs/HANDOFF.md` and each `docs/handoff/*.md` is within its cap (rule 8: a warning above 40 lines, a failure above 50), and every bullet starts with a date. No bullet is carried forward: compare each bullet, without its date, with the earlier versions of the same file. A bullet that was also in the previous version is carried once (a warning). A bullet that was also in the 2 previous versions is carried twice (a failure). Waiting bullets that name a pending PROPOSED block are not counted (check 8 covers them). Compare only when the file differs from the last version the check saw, so repeated runs in one session do not count as carries. With version control, read the earlier versions from the history. Without it, the check keeps its own snapshot in `test-results/handoff-previous.md` (on a team, `test-results/handoff-previous-<developer>.md` for each handoff file): the bullets of the last version it saw, each with its carry count. The check updates the snapshot only when the file changed. The AI never edits the snapshot.
3. Every `AC-n` in `SPEC.md` outside PROPOSED blocks (lines that start with `>`) has a row in `RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md`, and every row has such an AC.
4. Every relative path and link in `README.md` and `docs/` exists. For every command in the area map and in `ARCHITECTURE.md` Commands, the script file or first word it names exists; the check does not run it.
5. Every file in `docs/` is listed in `AGENTS.md`, or on its Not used or Kept as is line (contents of `docs/decisions/`, `docs/images/`, `docs/plans/`, `docs/handoff/`, and `docs/archive/` are covered by their folder's entry). Every other doc file (`.md`, `.txt`, `.rst`, `.adoc`, `.docx`, `.pdf`) in the project root is a file from this standard, a common repository file (`LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `SECURITY`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`, with any extension), an older `AI-PROJECT-DOCS-STANDARD.md`, or on the Kept as is line. A file that fails is a candidate to absorb (see `references/standard.md`). The check does not scan subfolders such as package READMEs; the AI finds those while it works.
6. Every doc, except decision notes and `docs/archive/`, starts with a header line of the form `> Name: text`.
7. No file in `docs/` has a standard doc name plus a suffix such as `-v2`, `-old`, `-new`, `-copy`, or `-final`.
8. PROPOSED blocks older than 14 days are listed (a warning, not a failure).
9. No assignment-shaped secret in docs: `password`, `secret`, `api_key`, or `token`, followed by `=` or `:` and a value, or a private key header.
10. Every area in the area map, except *Docs*, has a heading with the same name in `docs/FEATURES.md`, and every feature heading there names an area in the map (a warning for an extra heading; a failure for a missing one).
11. `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` and `docs/FEATURES.md` each have a `Verified:` line (a warning if it is `(not yet verified)`, or if the date is older than the latest `Verified` date in `ARCHITECTURE.md`).

**Drift report** is a read-only report the AI writes before every release (rule 6) and whenever the developer asks ("run a drift report"). It never blocks and changes nothing. Each finding carries a certainty, and findings are never averaged. *Certain*: a mechanical check proves it. *Evidence*: the AI found it by reading, and the developer confirms it. *Inference*: a guess from dates, not from behavior.

| Finding | Certainty | How found |
|---|---|---|
| A SPEC feature or AC with no code behind it | Evidence | Area map ACs column against the code |
| Code with no SPEC coverage | Evidence | Folders not in any area map row, or rows with no ACs |
| An AC with no test, or a test with no AC | Certain | Area map ACs column against tests that cite `AC-n` in a name or comment |
| A command, folder, file, or link in the docs that does not exist | Certain | The docs check (paths, links, commands); the reviewer for anything else |
| A `DEVELOPMENT.md` step that fails from a clean state, or a `FEATURES.md` example that does not work | Evidence | The reviewer follows the steps and tries the examples (release, or the catch-up routine on request) |
| A doc section older than the code it describes | Inference | The Verified date against the change history: version-control history if any; else the work board Started dates and `CHANGELOG.md`; else "Not run: no change history". Compares dates, not behavior. |

The report goes in the task summary. Lasting findings go to `RESEARCH.md`. At a release, each finding is fixed or accepted by the developer.
