# Project rules
AI working rules for every AI tool on this project; CLAUDE.md and .github/copilot-instructions.md only point here. At most 120 lines and 1,200 words: cut any line whose removal would not cause mistakes.

## Project documentation standard
- Aligned to KEEL 2.2.0 (https://github.com/rickflashman/keel). Update when the docs are realigned.
- `KEEL.md` in the project root, else the KEEL skill, is the authority for the doc structure, else the existing docs; read it before you change that structure. Never change, move, or delete `KEEL.md` without the developer's instruction.
- Precedence, highest first: developer instruction > docs/decisions/ > SPEC.md and DESIGN.md (accepted text, not PROPOSED blocks) > ARCHITECTURE.md and PLAN.md > DEVELOPMENT.md, FEATURES.md, RUNBOOK.md, USER-GUIDE.md, and MOCKUP.md (mockups only) > HANDOFF.md and RESEARCH.md > CHANGELOG.md (history only) > the code (evidence only) > docs/archive/ (never a source).

## Commands
- In README.md (from the ticket), docs/DEVELOPMENT.md (setup and run), and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md. Record new commands in ARCHITECTURE.md only.

## Conventions
- (Project rules, 1 per line, added when a real mistake happens: `Must | Never | Prefer: the rule. Why: the reason.` Example: `Must: a header comment on every file. Why: sessions start without memory.`)
- Ask before touching: (paths that always need a ready card, such as auth, migrations, CI; or "(none)")
- Area owners: (optional: area, owner, review required; delete if unused)

## Making changes
- Classify first, then act by class:
  - Small (1 area, no shared code): change directly; targeted tests.
  - Shared (shared code, data model, auth, build config, a dependency upgrade, a cross-area refactor, or an ask-before-touching path): an approved ready card (docs/PLAN.md Definition of ready) first; affected tests; then a fresh-context review of the diff against the ACs.
  - Release: docs/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md, with a full regression.
- A multi-file change or an unclear approach also needs a ready card. Claim a work board row before a Shared or multi-file change.
- Bug fix: first reproduce it with a saved failing test or captured error output; no repro, no fix. Never guess a version pin. If the same fix fails twice, stop and ask.
- Update the affected docs in the same task: search docs/ for each path, name, label, and behavior you changed (names: area map, SPEC Glossary). Edit docs directly, except: SPEC and DESIGN get a PROPOSED block next to the text, never only in chat (`> PROPOSED YYYY-MM-DD (tool): the edit. Reason: ... Code: path.`); DESIGN-GUIDE.html is regenerated from DESIGN.md, never edited by hand. Never create a second version of a doc (such as SPEC-v2.md).
- Doc files outside this standard (notes, Word files, a second README): offer to absorb each one into its target docs and archive the original; do not link to it as a source.

## Testing
- Read the Testing section and area map in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md before you search the code. Reading files near your change is fine; use the map for what is not near.
- Targeted: new and updated tests, the changed area's tests, and the docs check. Affected: targeted plus the areas that use the changed code, or any area a failure points to. Never retest unchanged areas. A full regression outside a release needs the developer's approval.
- Run only saved commands from the area map; save each new test and add its command; each test names the AC it covers. Each command writes test-results/latest.md; check the exit code and the counts. Test interactively only to debug, to explore a new check, or for visual checks.
- Never weaken, skip, or delete a test to make it pass; report the failure and its cause. After 3 test-fix rounds, stop and report.

## Reporting
- Lead with the result. No preamble, recap, or effort estimates; lists of at most 5 items. Show errors and failing tests in full.
- Before reporting done, re-read the Definition of done in docs/PLAN.md and your ready card, and end with the task summary it defines, every line present.
- A check you could not run is "Not run: reason", never passed. A pass claim cites test-results/latest.md. To dismiss a review finding, cite the file and line that shows it is wrong.

## Decisions
- Before a structural or technology choice, check docs/decisions/. Never reverse a decision: write a new note, then set the old note's Status to "Superseded by NNNN", the only edit allowed.
- Record choices that are hard to reverse or affect several files. New note: docs/decisions/NNNN-short-title.md, the next number (renumber yours on a collision), the format of the newest note or the KEEL template, no ticket ID. Mention new notes in your summary.

## Session handoff
- Handoff file: docs/HANDOFF.md (teams: docs/handoff/<developer>.md). Start routine: read it and the work board in docs/PLAN.md; state the next action in 1 line.
- After a long gap, or when asked "catch me up": follow the KEEL catch-up routine (read-only; DEVELOPMENT.md, FEATURES.md, the handoff, and the work board; print a briefing of at most 15 lines).
- Close routine, when the developer closes the session, before any compact or clear, or when most of the context is used: follow the steps and routes at the top of the handoff file (if it is missing, use the KEEL handoff template). After a close at the context limit, tell the developer to start a new session from the handoff file.
- At most 40 lines; every bullet dated; never copy a bullet forward, even with a new date (the docs check counts carries). Do not rewrite it after every change; if something important would be lost before the close, record it now. On a conflict, the other docs win: flag it.

## Always / Never
- Always: mention the ticket ID when describing work.
- Never: put secrets in code or docs; edit docs/archive/.

## Docs (read the one that matches your task)
- docs/SPEC.md: requirements, glossary, constraints.
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md: area map, structure, commands, environment facts, operations. Read before structural changes.
- docs/PLAN.md: work board, Definition of ready and done. (docs/plans/M<n>.md: per-milestone boards, when used.)
- docs/DEVELOPMENT.md: how to set up, run, test, and debug. Update when those steps change.
- docs/FEATURES.md: what exists and how to use each feature. Update when a feature or its usage changes.
- docs/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md: before every release. A human approves.
- docs/decisions/: past decisions.
- docs/CHANGELOG.md: 1 entry at each release (create at the first); read only the top entries.
- docs/DESIGN.md: before touching UI.
- docs/USER-GUIDE.md: end-user guide in STE, for current behavior.
- docs/RUNBOOK.md: operations for support staff.
- docs/images/: images used by the docs.
- docs/MOCKUP.md: before mockups.
- docs/RESEARCH.md: before researching again; save research worth keeping.
- docs/archive/: migrated and absorbed originals; INDEX.md says what replaced each.
- Not used (developer decision; do not recreate or report missing): (none)
- Kept as is (developer decision; do not offer to absorb): (none)

## Skills (.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md)
- When a task matches a skill listed here, follow its SKILL.md (some tools do not scan this folder).
- (`<skill-name>`: one-line purpose. Leave empty if none.)
